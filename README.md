Densely Packed Decimal
======
C and Verilog implementations that show how to pack 3 decimal digits into 10 bits with no real math.

Note that these are coded to try to show the algorithm. More efficient implementations are certainly possible
and desireable. However, the synthesizer or compiler may optmize much of this anyway, so your milage may
vary.
